## How to create a community
In the plebbit protocol, a seedit community is called a _subplebbit_. To run a subplebbit, you can choose between two options:

1. If you prefer to use a **GUI**, download the desktop version of the Seedit client, available for Windows, MacOS and Linux: [latest release](https://github.com/plebbit/seedit/releases/latest). Create a subplebbit using using the familiar old.reddit-like UI, and modify its settings to your liking. The app runs an IPFS node, meaning you have to keep it running to have your board online.
2. If you prefer to use a **command line interface**, install plebbit-cli, available for Windows, MacOS and Linux: [latest release](https://github.com/plebbit/plebbit-cli/releases/latest). Follow the instructions in the readme of the repo. When running the daemon for the first time, it will output WebUI links you can use to manage your subplebbit with the ease of the GUI.

Peers can connect to your subplebbit using any plebbit client, such as Plebchan or Seedit. They only need the subplebbit's address, which is not stored in any central database, as plebbit is a pure peer-to-peer protocol.

### How to add a community to the default list (p/all)
The default list of communities, used on p/all on Seedit, is plebbit's [temporary-default-subplebbits](https://github.com/plebbit/temporary-default-subplebbits) list. You can open a pull request in that repo to add your subplebbit to the list, or contact devs via telegram [@plebbit](https://t.me/plebbit). In the future, this process will be automated by submitting proposals to a plebbit DAO, using the [plebbit token](https://etherscan.io/token/0xea81dab2e0ecbc6b5c4172de4c22b6ef6e55bd8f).
